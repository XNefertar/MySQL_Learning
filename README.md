# MySQL_Learning
This repository is a collection of my learning progress and code related to MySQL. It serves as a personal reference for my journey in mastering MySQL, including examples, scripts, and exercises I've completed along the way. The goal of this repository is to document my exploration of MySQL concepts, queries, database design, and best practices.

Feel free to explore the code and resources as I continue to improve and expand my knowledge in database management with MySQL.
